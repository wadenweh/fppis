# Functional Programming Principles in Scala (fppis)

This repository is for the supervised self-improvement program (ssi) at Trivadis utilizing the coursera course [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun).

The [course syllabus](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun) is mainted, but expanded to a bi-weekly basis.

## Code of conduct

## Branching

We follow the Driessen's [branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), recommending [Git-Flow](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/) for the execution.

In particular we encourage the follwing "feature" naming:

    https://github.com/normenmueller/progfun/feature/<staff code>-<#>

for example

    https://github.com/normenmueller/progfun/feature/euk-1
